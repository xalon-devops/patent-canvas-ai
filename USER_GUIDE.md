3. **Provide Details**: Specifics beat generalizations
4. **Include Use Cases**: Real-world applications
5. **Address Problems**: What issues does it solve?

### Prior Art Strategy
1. **Search Early**: Before investing $1,000
2. **Search Broadly**: Don't be too specific
3. **Review Carefully**: Read similar patents fully
4. **Adapt If Needed**: Modify your approach based on findings
5. **Document Differences**: Note what makes yours unique

### AI Q&A Best Practices
